    "## 1. Project Goal\n",
    "* The goal of this project is to find an efficient way to reform the bus routes for minimize the quantity of busses\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Some ideas\n",
    "* Since we have all the students and stops information, we can use some kind of algorithm to design a way for all the buses.\n",
    "* Yes we can do it with a brute-force search. However, let's say if there is a school, you need to stop by 100 stops to make sure all the students can get on the bus. The brute-force search iteration can lead you 100! iterations which is the factorial of 100. That is too huge to compute! And this is only one school and 100 stops for example. Let alone all the schools and stops!\n",
    "* Actually if we do it with brute-force search, it could be some thing like a ['Travelling salesman problem'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), it's definitely an NP - hard problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Approach Design\n",
    "* So our main idea is described as the picture below. In this picture, we use the orange circle in the middle to represent one school, and use the blue circles around the orange one to represent all the stops we need to stop by for this school. \n",
    "* We use google map API to get all the latitude and longitude for the stops and schools.\n",
    "* We calculate the angles between school and its stops. And use K-means to cluster all of the stops only by their angles. In the picture below, we use line to divide the stops to make it like a pizza. For each cluster, we use one bus to go from the farest stop to the nearest stop between school.\n",
    "* And then we use left-top cluster as an example. But before that, you may think now that are the stops few enough for the computer to brute-force compute the shortest way to the shcool? The answer is not. Because it still has like 14 or 15 stops, so if we iterate all the possible stops, the computation would be still the factorial of 15 which is hundreds of billions iterations.\n",
    "* So for the left-top cluster, we divided them into three smaller clusters, only by their proximity to each others. In the picture below, we use three circles to represent the three smaller clusters. And then for each smaller cluster(circle), we calculate the mean distance between the school for the stops in the small cluster(circle). And we can sort the three mean distance.\n",
    "* Finally, we go from the farest mean-distance circle to the nearest mean-distance circle. And for each stop in the circle we only calculate their distance to the school, and sort them also from farest to nearest.\n",

    "## 4. Code Implementation\n",
    "* The code is as below. There will be some draft and tests in the code. However, we tried to comment some useless outputs to make this file more readable. And also we made the code part to some kinds of small parts. \n",
    "* For this update(11/20/2018), we have successfully complete our method to reroute the buses!"

    "* As you can see, for this cluster, the bus picking up sequence will be [22, 15, 7, 20, 3, 4, 5, 16, 2, 18, 9, 24, 10, 6, 17, 11, 25, 23, 12, 0, 19, 1, 14, 8, 13, 21]. And there are some other clusters going to 'BAR' school. The next thing we should do is to do the same thing for other clusters and schools. And if we complete these things, it will be easy to set up the time(But there will be another problem, we don't know if we can just use time = distance / speed or we need to use google map api again to set up the driving time)\n",
    "* The algorithm is not the most optimized one but quite a practical and useful one. However, we can optimize more on our algorithm if we need to.\n",
    "* As for the picking up time in the afternoon, we think it's just the reversed thing of the morning.\n",
    "* Probably we will integrete our code together and try to make it into one function."

    "* Problem:However, because the bus capacity is limited, for some routes which we have too many students, we need to send maybe two buses in a row to pick up all the students, so perhaps there will be about 11 buses for 'BAR' school and it's still less than the orignal number: 14!  But for now it's just our first thinking of the solution, maybe we will have better solutions in the future.\n",
